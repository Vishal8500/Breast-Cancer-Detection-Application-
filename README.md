# HistoAI: Intelligent Early Cancer Detection

HistoAI takes the uncertainty out of early cancer detection with intelligent, data-driven precision. Designed to support doctors and empower patients, it leverages cutting-edge machine learning to analyze diagnostic data, spot subtle patterns, and predict the risk of breast cancer ‚Äî faster and more accurately than ever before.

From real-time analysis to personalized risk assessments, HistoAI bridges the gap between technology and healthcare, delivering results that matter when time is critical. It‚Äôs smart, seamless, and built for a future where AI and medicine work hand in hand to save lives.

---

## Development Preparation

### Frontend and Backend
- Built frontend using **React**.
- Built backend using **Flask** with integrated machine learning models.

### Dockerization
- Wrote Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend.
- Containerized applications to ensure consistency across environments.

### Version Control
- Initialized a Git repository.
- Managed all codebases (frontend, backend, Docker) within the repository.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Execution (Jenkins)

### Jenkins Setup
- Configured Jenkins to automate Continuous Integration.
- Pipeline pulls latest code from Git repository upon push.

### Docker Build and Deployment
- Built Docker images for frontend and backend through Jenkins.
- Employed multi-stage builds for optimized, lightweight images.
- Used **Docker Compose** for container orchestration.
- Tuned port mappings (backend: `5000`, frontend: `80/443`).

### Pipeline Optimization
- Leveraged caching and alternative sources to speed up Docker image builds.
- Streamlined the overall build and deployment workflow for maximum efficiency.

---

## Deployment and Validation

### Local Deployment
- Deployed containers locally using Docker.
- Verified full-stack communication and app functionality.

### Automated End-to-End Testing
- Integrated automated test scripts into the Jenkins pipeline.
- Conducted comprehensive end-to-end validations across deployments.

---

## Outcome and Impact

- **Completed Deployment**: Full-stack application deployed successfully and accessible via `http://localhost:5000`.
- **Boosted Development Efficiency**: Consistent and repeatable deployments with Jenkins, accelerating release cycles.
- **Prepared for Scalability**: Ready to scale up to production-grade environments seamlessly.
